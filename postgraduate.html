            <h3>Game of Life University Coursework</h3>

            <p>For this project I recreated the Conway game of life. Once doing this I created an interface that could be used to check for the apperance of certain standard shapes such as blocks and beehives up to more complex shapes such as ships. This was the first project I worked on in C++.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
            <ul>   
                <li> Learnt the core parts of C++ such as header files and how these worked alongside main files. </li>
                <li> I had not used visual studio for development before this project and so learnt about the IDE and how to best take advantage of the tools it provided such as the debug & breakpoint tools. </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>

            <p>For this project I used OpenGl to create a graphics based project. This was the first time I looked into using a graphics API.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
            <ul>   
                <li> Built upon my C++ skills. </li>
                <li> Began learning how graphics APIs work and how this can be used for games.</li>
            </ul>
