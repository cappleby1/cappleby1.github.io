                <p>For my Undergraduate dissertation, I looked into using video games for physical rehabiliation purposes. This could include for example, patients recoving from surgery or those with life long conditions. The aim of this disseration was to create a video game that would assist with improving a patients fine motor skills. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Technologies this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li>Python (OpenCV) - the python section of this project was used to track the user's hands. This would create the coordinates needed for the unity section of the project.</li>
                    <li>Unity - the unity section of this project is the main section of the software and is what the user would interact with.</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>

                <p>For this project I recreated the Conway game of life. Once doing this I created an interface that could be used to check for the apperance of certain standard shapes such as blocks and beehives up to more complex shapes such as ships.</p>
