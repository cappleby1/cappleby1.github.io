                <p>For my Undergraduate dissertation, I looked into using video games for physical rehabiliation purposes. This could include for example, patients recoving from surgery or those with life long conditions. The aim of this disseration was to create a video game that would assist with improving a patients fine motor skills. </p>

                <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li>Python (OpenCV) - the python section of this project was used to track the user's hands. This would create the coordinates needed for the unity section of the project.</li>
                    <li>Unity - the unity section of this project is the main section of the software and is what the user would interact with.</li>
                    <li> This project was the first time I looked at using an input that was not keyboard & mouse. That was my main first focus of the project.</li>
                    <li> This was also my first time using python with another language and so a lot of the project was spent understanding how to link the two which led to me using python sockets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Game Engineering Coursework</h3>

                <p> This is my undergraduate game engineering coursework.This project was the first time I used 3D in unity. This was very different from the 2D platforming style of work I had completed previously.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li> I looked at unity AI for the first time (including using a nav mesh). This allowed me to have a better understanding of game AI and introduced me to using nav meshes for games.</li>
                    <li> This was the first time I used state machines for enemies rather than having a set movement path. </li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>

                <img src="Images/gameoflife.png" alt="Game of life image">

                <p>For this project I recreated the Conway game of life. Once doing this I created an interface that could be used to check for the apperance of certain standard shapes such as blocks and beehives up to more complex shapes such as ships. This was the first project I worked on in C++.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li> Learnt the core parts of C++ such as header files and how these worked alongside main files. </li>
                    <li> I had not used visual studio for development before this project and so learnt about the IDE and how to best take advantage of the tools it provided such as the debug & breakpoint tools. </li>
                </ul>

                <p>For this project I used OpenGl to create a graphics based project. This was the first time I looked into using a graphics API.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li> Built upon my C++ skills. </li>
                    <li> Began learning how graphics APIs work and how this can be used for games.</li>

                <p>For my A Level coursework I created a basic platformer game with one level that could be completed by the player by reaching the goal. This was the first game development project I undertook. From this I learnt a lot about using C# as a language and how game engines work and can be used.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Technologies & skills this project included were:</p>
                <ul>   
                    <li> Began to learn C# and unity.</li>
                    <li> First bit of game engineering work I ever completed</li>
                    <li> Completed the project without the use of an IDE (Notepad++)</li>
