            <p>For my A Level coursework I created a basic platformer game with one level that could be completed by the player by reaching the goal. This was the first game development project I undertook. From this I learnt a lot about using C# as a language and how game engines work and can be used.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h4>Technologies & skills this project included were:</h4>
            <ul>   
                <li> Began to learn C# and unity.</li>
                <li> First bit of game engineering work I ever completed.</li>
                <li> Completed the project without the use of an IDE (Notepad++).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I was interested in other game engines and so I began to work on a Godot project - this project is very early in development and is ongoing.</p>

            <p>For this project I created a mobile app that allows the user to scan a QR code and spawn a box that can be interacted with. I used ZXing for this project with unity. It was my first time working with XR and I found it very interesting to learn about.</p>
