            <p>For my Undergraduate dissertation, I looked into using video games for physical rehabiliation purposes. This could include for example, patients recoving from surgery or those with life long conditions. The aim of this disseration was to create a video game that would assist with improving a patients fine motor skills. </p>

            <h4>Technologies & skills this project included were:</h4>
            <ul>   
                <li>Python (OpenCV) - the python section of this project was used to track the user's hands. This would create the coordinates needed for the unity section of the project.</li>
                <li>Unity - the unity section of this project is the main section of the software and is what the user would interact with.</li>
                <li> This project was the first time I looked at using an input that was not keyboard & mouse. That was my main first focus of the project.</li>
                <li> This was also my first time using python with another language and so a lot of the project was spent understanding how to link the two which led to me using python sockets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Game Engineering Coursework</h3>
            <hr class="dotted-line">

            <p> This is my undergraduate game engineering coursework.This project was the first time I used 3D in unity. This was very different from the 2D platforming style of work I had completed previously.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h4>Technologies & skills this project included were:</h4>
            <ul>   
                <li> I looked at unity AI for the first time (including using a nav mesh). This allowed me to have a better understanding of game AI and introduced me to using nav meshes for games.</li>
                <li> This was the first time I used state machines for enemies rather than having a set movement path. </li>
            </ul>
